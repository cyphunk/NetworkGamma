This is a small OSX command line tool that accepts r,g,b gamma 
thresholds from UDP port 4740 by default. The version in
build/debug was compiled for OSX 10.6 (should work on 10.5 
as well). Included is a processing sketch that will change
the gamma values as a sin wave. The sketch requires the UDP
library from:

http://ubaa.net/shared/processing/udp/documentation/udp/udp_class_udp.htm

If you do not want to use processing you can send the values
from another terminal with:
 echo -ne '\x7f\x7f\x00' | nc -u localhost 4047

Remember, at the moment 127 (7f) is the highest value
accepted. (fixplease?)

do whatever you wish with the code. no license.
